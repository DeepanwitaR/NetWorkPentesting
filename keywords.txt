hosting a ftp and a server via python exposing the libraries on your desktop system:

python -m pyftpdlib -p 21 w

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
stages of hacking:
1. reconnaissance - passive/ active (info gathering) - email list, geography.
2. scanning and enumeration - nmap, nessus, nikto, etc.
3. gaining access
4. maintaining access
5. covering tracks - psexec, you go via a shell. 

we must make sure the hosts we are looking at is actually their's.

what are subdomains?

incase bluto does not work https://youtu.be/3Kq1MIfTWCE?t=19143
check bluto github.

Netscraft
crt.sh - %.tesla.com

Netscraft - what techs a site is using.
crt.sh - %.tesla.com - all the subdomains and domains come up.

Fingerprinting - take a data and map its origin.
wappalyzer extension - what frameworks, etc. the site is built on. 
check if those frameworks, etc. wok correct.
we are looking at network look at the host, thus focus on code exec 
mainly to break in network.
dont pentest a website, that is often not the scope.
 webapps and

whatweb -v tesla.com - what javascript fw, etc.
hackerone- bug bounty reports.
builtwith.com

brute forcing Sub-Domains
finding the breach password list.

>> we have now gathered a lot of info from the site.

Scanning and tools:
- stealth scanning with the nmap.
udp - dhcp
what is NAT?

slealth scan:
syn
syn ack
rst - we dont want jk.

nmap -T4 -A -p- 192.168.188.128

improving the nmap scan, we do a technique called staging:
nmap -T4 -p- 192.168.188.128 (break search in bits, not all blocks)
scan some ports:
nmap -T4 -A -p22,80 192.168.188.128

nmap -T4 -A -p22,80 192.168.188.128 -oA client
now you have:
Bluto  client.gnmap  client.nmap  client.xml

>> since they are bash commands, you may use these to build a linux 
script.

>> now scanning with udp. (dont forget to look).
nmap -sU -T4 192.168.188.128
ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ - all these scripts to detect 
vulnerablities, have a hunch and then run these scripts.

nmap -p 443 --script=ssl-enum-ciphers tesla.com ( what cyphers used 
on the other side).

>> enumeration:

netdiscover -r 192.168.202.0/24 
(working on ARP scan - mac and simultaneous ip) 
ip of a router?
keepnotes - keep taking notes.

fire up nessus, currently at https://youtu.be/3Kq1MIfTWCE?t=25390
port scan, and known web vulnerabilities.
launch
https://youtu.be/3Kq1MIfTWCE?t=27660

we can do the nmap alongside.

https://youtu.be/3Kq1MIfTWCE?t=25676, some config change on nessux 
attempted.
Service detection - vulns in nessus what all are running.
mind false positives.
not enough enough tho, look at more details.
what are they running on ports? why why those?
RDP.
not to focus on what the headers etc look like.

look at the site, does it suggest poor hygeine.
Greenshot screenshot software.
apache address checkout - try nikto on it.

shows - server details, etc. but alot of it pertains to web pentest.
shows stuff like vulnerabilities, and what are outdated.


dirbuster -> we have a dataset, are those data on the web?
OWASP ?
https://youtu.be/3Kq1MIfTWCE?t=26797
sometimes you see data, again is a person be able to see it.

curl --head <ip>
server header info disclosure.
invert the picture. dark to white BG.

<http ip>/dsklfsidln
report the error page if its bad and generic like maybe.
disclosure

cve details; find on googling the vulns in the nessus.
or find details and report them.
